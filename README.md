# Facial recognition an added security level to mobiles and laptops
This project aims to add a rich security measure to the most commonly used devices(Mobiles and laptops).The methodology will be bottom- up approach, we will implement core python modules for gathering known faces, storage management and recognition against new face. Then we would be integrating those modules with Kivy cross platform python framework.
Advantages:
-Easy authentication.
-Increased security.
-Reduces the need to remember complex passwords.
Outcome:
-A platform for facial authentication in Android, ios, Windows, Linux and Mac devices.
-Image log of intruders.
-Automation of start up scripts.
